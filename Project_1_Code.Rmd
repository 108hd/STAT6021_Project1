```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
data <- read.csv('diamonds4.csv')
```

## Individual Variable Code

Here is a place to put any code or visualizations we need to perform

### Color

```{r}

```


### Clarity

```{r}

```


### Carat 

```{r}
meancarat<-mean(data$carat)
mediancarat<-median(data$carat)


#Checking the spread
hist(data$carat)


```

Average carat size is .81344
Median carat size is .52

### Cut 

```{r}

```


### Price

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Regression Code

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
